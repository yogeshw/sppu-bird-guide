\chapter*{Introduction}

\introsection{%
  The University of Pune (Savitribai Phule Pune University) campus is a biodiversity hotspot spread across 411 acres (166.33 hectares) in the heart of Pune city. Located at 18.5529°N 73.8352°E, the campus sits at an elevation of approximately 560 meters above sea level.

  \section*{Campus Environment}
  The campus features diverse habitats that support a rich variety of birdlife. The landscape includes extensive wooded areas with native and exotic tree species, open grasslands, lawns, artificial water bodies, gardens, and building complexes. This mosaic of habitats provides excellent opportunities for both resident and migratory birds.

  \section*{Flora and Vegetation}
  The university grounds host over 150 species of trees, creating a veritable urban forest. Native species like Banyan (\textit{Ficus benghalensis}), Peepal (\textit{Ficus religiosa}), Neem (\textit{Azadirachta indica}), and Red Silk Cotton (\textit{Bombax ceiba}) dominate the landscape, while ornamental and introduced species like African Blackwood (\textit{Dalbergia melanoxylon}), Rain Tree (\textit{Samanea saman}), Gulmohar (\textit{Delonix regia}), and Copper Pod (\textit{Peltophorum pterocarpum}) add to the diversity. This rich vegetation provides vital nesting sites, roosting areas, and food sources for various bird species.
}{%
   
  \section*{Human Impact}
  The campus ecosystem faces various anthropogenic pressures that affect bird populations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Regular vehicular movement along campus roads
  \item Ongoing construction and development activities
  \item Presence of a large student population
  \item Regular maintenance activities including gardening and landscaping
  \item Noise and dust pollution from nearby urban areas
  \item Light pollution from campus buildings and facilities
  \end{itemize}
}

\introsection{%
  \section*{When to Watch}
  \textbf{Time of Day:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Early morning (6:00-9:00 AM): Peak activity as birds forage for breakfast
  \item Late afternoon (4:00-6:30 PM): Second wave of feeding activity
  \item Midday: Good for watching raptors soaring on thermal currents
  \item Dusk: Best time to spot nocturnal species like owls becoming active
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Seasonal Highlights:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Winter (November-February): Peak season with numerous winter visitors
  \item Monsoon (June-September): Best for watching breeding activities
  \item Summer (March-May): Good for observing resident breeding birds
  \item Post-monsoon (October): Opportunity to spot passage migrants
  \end{itemize}
}{%
  \section*{Acknowledgments}
  Special thanks to the dedicated birdwatchers 
  who have contributed extensively to documenting 
  the avifauna of SPPU campus through eBird 
(\href{https://ebird.org/hotspot/L1838309}{SPPU eBird Hotspot}).
   
  Their systematic observations have greatly enhanced our 
  understanding of bird diversity and seasonal patterns 
  on campus.

\introsection{%
  \section*{How to Watch}
  \textbf{Essential Equipment:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Binoculars: 8x42 or 10x42 recommended for beginners
  \item Field guide: I highly recommend 
  \textit{Birds of the Indian Subcontinent} by Grimmett, Inskipp \& Inskipp
  \item Notebook for recording observations
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Useful Apps:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item eBird: For recording sightings and exploring hotspots
  \item Merlin Bird ID: Helps identify birds through photos or sounds
  \item BirdNet: AI-powered bird sound identification
  \end{itemize}
}{%
  \section*{More Tips}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wear earth-toned clothing to blend with surroundings
  \item Move slowly and quietly to avoid startling birds
  \item Avoid using flash photography
  \item Keep a safe distance from nests and breeding areas
  \item Record your observations in eBird after each session
  \end{itemize}

  \section*{About This Guide}
  This field guide documents the diverse bird species 
  found within the university campus. The most common 
  species, which represent about half the bird species 
  recorded on campus, are included here.
  
  Each entry includes 
  detailed information about the bird's appearance, 
  behavior, and habitat preferences, 
  accompanied by high-quality photographs. 
  The nomenclature follows current taxonomic standards, 
  with both scientific and common names provided for 
  easy reference.
