\chapter*{Introduction}

\introsection{%
  The University of Pune (Savitribai Phule Pune University) campus is a biodiversity hotspot spread across 411 acres (166.33 hectares) in the heart of Pune city. Located at 18.5529°N 73.8352°E, the campus sits at an elevation of approximately 560 meters above sea level.

  \section*{Campus Environment}
  The campus features diverse habitats that support a rich variety of birdlife. The landscape includes extensive wooded areas with native and exotic tree species, open grasslands, lawns, artificial water bodies, gardens, and building complexes. This mosaic of habitats provides excellent opportunities for both resident and migratory birds.

  \section*{Flora and Vegetation}
  The university grounds host over 150 species of trees, creating a veritable urban forest. Native species like Banyan (\textit{Ficus benghalensis}), Peepal (\textit{Ficus religiosa}), and Neem (\textit{Azadirachta indica}) dominate the landscape, while ornamental and introduced species add to the diversity. This rich vegetation provides vital nesting sites, roosting areas, and food sources for various bird species.
}{%
  \section*{Water Resources}
  Water bodies on campus play a crucial role in supporting bird populations. These include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A large artificial reservoir that serves as the main campus lake
  \item Several small ponds and water features scattered throughout the grounds
  \item Seasonal water accumulations during the monsoon period
  \end{itemize}

  \section*{Human Impact}
  The campus ecosystem faces various anthropogenic pressures that affect bird populations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Regular vehicular movement along campus roads
  \item Ongoing construction and development activities
  \item Presence of a large student population (over 40,000)
  \item Regular maintenance activities including gardening and landscaping
  \item Noise pollution from nearby urban areas
  \item Light pollution from campus buildings and facilities
  \end{itemize}
}

\introsection{%
  \section*{Conservation Efforts}
  The university administration has implemented several measures to protect and enhance campus biodiversity:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Establishment of designated quiet zones
  \item Protection of wooded areas and mature trees
  \item Restricted access to sensitive wildlife habitats
  \item Regular monitoring of bird populations
  \item Environmental awareness programs for students and staff
  \end{itemize}
}{%
  \section*{About This Guide}
  This field guide documents the diverse bird species found within the university campus. Each entry includes detailed information about the bird's appearance, behavior, and habitat preferences, accompanied by high-quality photographs. The nomenclature follows current taxonomic standards, with references to the comprehensive Book of Indian Birds (\href{https://archive.org/download/BookOfIndianBirds/BookIndianBirds.pdf}{available online}) and updates from \href{https://indianbirds.in/pdfs/IB_11_5_6_Final.pdf}{Indian Birds} journal.
